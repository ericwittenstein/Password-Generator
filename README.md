# Unit-3-Challenge
## Homework assignment for Unit 3: JavaScript

## Having read the instructions, I have, to the best of my abilities, done the following:

- modified the provided javascript file to meet the necessary acceptance criteria for a password generator that asks the user for length and character types to be included, and returns a randomly generated password based on that input
- based on feedback from previous assignments, added screenshots and links to this readme
- pushed my files to GitHub and deployed them to a live site through GitHub
- submitted the deployed application URL and GitHub repo to BCS for review and grading
